/*
 *
 *
 *   Libfre library  -  Perl-like regular expression on POSIX ERE engine.
 *
 *
 */


This small library will give its users access to this one simple function:

    fre_bind(char *pattern, char *string, size_t string_size);

Which let its users use Perl's REGEX syntax and operations on POSIX.1-2008 systems
with no extra dependencies. 

Fre_bind tries to mimic as closely as possible Perl's bind operator '=~' that
binds a regex pattern against a string, executing the operation designated by
the pattern used.
(A short manpage explaining fre_bind's behavior is available under "man_page_src.d/".)

Libfre tries to achieve POSIX conformance by converting any Perl-like elements of a
given pattern that are not POSIX compatible into POSIX constructs
Results and behaviours of a given pattern depends greatly on your locale.

'fre' stands for "Findf Regular Expression" since it was first born within the Libfindf library,
and I'm not very original with names.

A copy of my personal notes on features available and those to be implemented
is called Features.txt, in the main directory of this repo.


-Version 0.00 up to 1.00 will concentrate on making things works, especialy the 3 basic operations:
   match, substitution and transliteration,will and on adding support for most if not all non-POSIX compatible
   Perl-like constructs.
   "Messy" functions or blocks will be either cleaned/simplified or simply rewritten before v1.00.
   A short manpage is to be added before v1.00 and likely extended with every added features and functionalities.


-Further versions will concentrate on profiling and optimizations.

Take warning that it has been tested only on Linux Debian 8.5, using Glibc 2.19 and Gcc 4.9.2-10.

Note that I'm always using a 132x32 terminal window, sorry for the inconvinience.

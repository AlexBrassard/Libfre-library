/*
 *
 *
 *   Libfre library  -  Perl-like regular expression on POSIX ERE engine.
 *
 *
 */


This small library will give user the access to one simple function:

fre_bind(perl-like_regex_pattern, string);

which tries to mimic as closely as possible Perl's bind operator '=~' that
binds a regex pattern against a string, executing the operation designated by
the pattern used

The user's given Perl-like regular expression will then be parsed internaly
by the library

'fre' stands for "Findf Regular Expression" since it was first born within the Libfindf library,
and I'm not very original with names.

I will carefuly explain what the fre_bind() function does once I get it sorted out! :)

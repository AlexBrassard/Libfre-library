/*
 *
 *
 *   Libfre library  -  Perl-like regular expression on POSIX ERE engine.
 *
 *
 */


This small library will give user the access to one simple function:

fre_bind(perl-like_regex_pattern, string, string_size);

Fre_bind tries to mimic as closely as possible Perl's bind operator '=~' that
binds a regex pattern against a string, executing the operation designated by
the pattern used.

Libfre achieves to keep POSIX conformance by converting any Perl-like elements of a
given pattern into POSIX constructs.


'fre' stands for "Findf Regular Expression" since it was first born within the Libfindf library,
and I'm not very original with names.


Version 0.00 up to 1.00 will concentrate on making things works, especialy the 3 basic operations:
match, substitution and transliteration, with only limited support for most non-POSIX compatible
Perl-like constructs.
"Messy" functions or blocks will be either cleaned/simplified or simply rewritten before v1.00.

Version 1.01 up to 2.00 will concentrate on adding support for most if not all non-POSIX compatible
Perl-like constructs.

Further versions will concentrate on profiling and optimizations.

I will carefuly explain what the fre_bind() function does once I get it sorted out! :)
